I’m an independent researcher based in Beijing with a background in history, economics, tech policy and Chinese. My biggest intellectual influences are [Tyler Cowen](https://marginalrevolution.com/), [Scholar Stage](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/), and [Lil Wayne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VhHKmeqS48).

You can contact me at jorschneider@gmail.com, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jordanschnyc) or [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jorschneider).

The past few years I’ve been hosting an interview-based podcast called [ChinaEconTalk](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/chinaecontalk/id1289062927?mt=2) about Chinese tech, economics and politics. My best episodes include

* Journalist Peter Hessler [on Egypt and China](https://supchina.com/2019/06/11/chinaecontalk-peter-hessler-talks-china-egypt/)
* Former diplomat Jake Sullivan on [US-China relations](https://supchina.com/podcast/an-alternate-vision-of-u-s-china-relations-with-jake-sullivan/)

* Comedian Turner Sparks on his misadventures in Suzhou [building a soft-serve ice cream empire](https://supchina.com/podcast/the-rise-and-fall-of-a-suzhou-soft-serve-baron/)

I also write a [newsletter](https://chinaecontalk.substack.com/) where I translate and analyze popular articles from Chinese-language media on tech and politics. Some of those best issues include

* [Huawei’s longstanding international ambitions](https://chinaecontalk.substack.com/p/chinaecontalk-inaugural-issue-huawei)
* [The death of bikesharing giant Ofo](https://chinaecontalk.substack.com/p/chinaecontalk-ridesharing-ofo-flew)

* [The impending AI winter](https://chinaecontalk.substack.com/p/a-chinese-ai-winter-on-the-horizon)
* [Hu vs. Xi Era China](https://chinaecontalk.substack.com/p/hu-era-xi-era)

I had a pretty awful brain injury in 2016 and blogged about it [here](http://tbilife.org/).

I previously worked at Chinese social media firm Kuaishou, the global macro hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, a Princeton University research organization Innovations for Successful Societies, and the political risk firm Eurasia Group. I grew up in New York City, have a BA in history from Yale, and an MA from Peking University, where I played Madison and Mulligan in a full production of Hamilton.
